⚠️ The app is not executable because the environment.ts is missing, which contains the API keys to firebase.
For reasons of security, this is not included in the repo.

## Note
The project is the exam for the module 'Entwicklung mobiler Applikationen' (Development of mobile applications), which we have visited in the winter semester 22/23 at the Technischen Hochschule Mittelhessen.
